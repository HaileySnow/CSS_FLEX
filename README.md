Activity 26: CSS_Flex

CSS Flex 

Here are the Flexbox properties I used in my code:

display: flex;
Enables the Flexbox layout, allowing child elements to align and distribute space effectively within the container.

justify-content: center;
Aligns child elements horizontally at the center of the container.

align-items: center;
Aligns child elements vertically at the center of the container.

flex-wrap: wrap;
Allows child elements to move to the next line if thereâ€™s not enough space.

gap: 20px;
Adds a 20px gap between child elements for spacing.
